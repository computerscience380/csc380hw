Homework 2 consists of implementing the first few requirements that you identified in homework 1 in a test-driven manner.  Start by writing jUnit tests that would satisfy your core functionality (as identified in your first few requirements). Make sure you write tests of sufficient coverage: you must test that your code works well, and you must also test that your code fails when it should. After you write the tests, implement the functionality that will first make them compile, and then make all of them pass.  We are moving to a distributed CVS, starting from this homework. Make a github account for your group and use git to commit your requirements document. After you are done with the tests, commit them; and after you are done with the functionality that satisfies the tests, commit the code, as well. Remember to use a good file structure, as discussed in class.  Submit a link to your github repository to the respective dropbox in Blackboard before the deadline. Each group member must make a submission to receive a grade.  Demonstrate your working homework within a week after the deadline. Make sure you know exactly what you are doing.
